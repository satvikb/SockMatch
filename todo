all thats left

collision if theoretical frame out of view go to start of belt?


gameplay
	-improve tutorial (make more interactive)
	-improve difficulty values
	-combos
		-extra score (+1 or +x based on combo's in a row) when multiple socks are packaged at once

graphics
	-sock and package designs
	-forklift tire trail

collisions
	-IMPROVE COLLISIONS.
	-back on belt when no space
	-prevent moving to top
	-prevent moving sock back on belt once removed?

ui
	-improve game over screen
		-replay (main button)
		-home (smaller to the left)
