all thats left

gameplay
	-improve tutorial (make more interactive)
	-harder gameplay over time
		-faster belt
		-introduce more sock types
		-introduce different sizes (S, M, L)
		-increase variability of generated socks (less likely to create socks already on screen)
	-factory efficiency instead of lives
	-combos
		-extra score (+1 or +x based on combo's in a row) when multiple socks are packaged at once
	-gameover
		-instead of stopping belt slowly maybe keep it going while showing game over.

graphics
	-conveyor belt overhead frame to the left
	-forklift texture
	-design factory floor
	-sock and package designs
	-forklifts on main menu carry boxes, not packages

collisions
	-IMPROVE COLLISIONS.
	-back on belt when no space
	-prevent moving to top
	-prevent moving sock back on belt once removed?


clearing socks on game over
	-maybe don't remove socks and allow use on next round? (socks on belt are animated out on belt while slowing down, prevent movement)

ui
	-pause button
	-switch view
		-shown while switching views, allows for game view to load and remove socks for game over
		-or just for loading, for game over the 'camera' can move to the right to the game over screen
	-maybe use images for buttons instead of text
	-maybe support more than 6 digits for score
	-improve custom Game Center leaderboard
		-maybe wood textures
		-users with no image use initials
	-improve game over screen
		-replay (main button)
		-replay (smaller to the left)
		-share (smaller to the right)

sounds
	-belt moving
	-forklift moving
	-light turning on
	-sock package
	-point

saving
	-save
		-difficulty curve
	-load
		-handle file load errors (corrupt file or modified)

fonts
	-4 variants (made for different uses)
		-titles/large text
		-one for buttons and
		-medium for normal text
		-small for detail text
	-game center leaderboard
		-title font (variant 0)
		-back button (variant 1)
		-name font (variant 2)
		-score font (variant 3)
	-tutorial text
	-possibly for score and buttons

gamecenter
	-prevent cheating (maybe use score context with saved high score to filter cheaters)

meta
	-confirm device universality
	-good icon
	-splash screen


bugs
	-socks on edge of screen
	-matching socks while stopping game is buggy
	-matching socks near belt overlap conveyor belt/wheels
	-prevent forklift overlapping (maybe have four sections with one in each section)

other code stuff
	-make sure @property's are right, learn what nonatomic/strong/assign/copy means
	-improve code, refactoring
	-improve containerviewcontroller (actually remove and create view controllers?)
	-anonymize code
