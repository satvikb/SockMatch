all thats left
-powerup socks
	-increase efficiency
	-slow dow belt for time (put timer between score and efficiency bar)

collision if theoretical frame out of view go to start of belt?


gameplay
	-improve tutorial (make more interactive)
	-improve difficulty values
	-combos
		-extra score (+1 or +x based on combo's in a row) when multiple socks are packaged at once
	-too many socks - remove efficiency with acceleration

graphics
	-sock and package designs
	-forklift tire trail?

collisions
	-IMPROVE COLLISIONS.
	-back on belt when no space
	**prevent moving to top
	-prevent moving sock back on belt once removed?

ui
	-improve pause button
	-too many socks alert

settings
	-credits

sounds
	-improve sock package
	-add point.wav

saving
	-load
		-handle file load errors (corrupt file or modified)

gamecenter
	-prevent cheating (maybe use score context with saved high score to filter cheaters)

meta
	-confirm device universality
	-good icon
	-splash screen

bugs
	-clicking play on menu while forklift is moving through screen changed speed of forklifts to a constant value
	-matching socks near belt overlap conveyor belt/wheels (put forklift below belt)
	-if the play button is above forklift pressing play changes it to be below
	-facing left forklifts while animating to game over
	-boxes in dead center don't get picked up?
	-as belt speeds up socks are hard to touch
	-invalidate timers in bg
	-collision - socks that auto move out can cost efficiency if moved out on belt
	-phone music stops when playing
	-random forklifts while transitioning scenes

crashes
	-

other code stuff
	-make sure @property's are right, learn what nonatomic/strong/assign/copy means
	-need all [array copy]'s?
	-improve code, refactoring
	-improve containerviewcontroller (actually remove and create view controllers?)
		-when changing views, use the parameter or the global variable?
		-random forklifts generation
	-anonymize code
	-check zPosition for child objects (under each view controller), if the base zPosition is required
