all thats left
-difficulty curve
-sound timings
-redo too many socks logic
gameplay
	-improve difficulty values
	-too many socks - remove efficiency with acceleration

ui
	-improve pause button
	-top of screen

sounds
	-improve sock package
	-compress sounds

saving
	-load
		-handle file load errors (corrupt file or modified)

gamecenter
	-prevent cheating (maybe use score context with saved high score to filter cheaters)

meta
	-confirm device universality
	-splash screen

bugs
	-as belt speeds up socks are hard to touch
	-invalidate timers in bg
	-collision - socks that auto move out can cost efficiency if moved out on belt
	-prevent random forklift overlap
	-warming up takes priority not moving title out of view
	-belt moving audio not in sync with belt

crashes
	-generating two large socks at once

other code stuff
	-make sure @property's are right, learn what nonatomic/strong/assign/copy means
	-need all [array copy]'s?
	-improve code, refactoring
	-improve containerviewcontroller (actually remove and create view controllers?)
		-when changing views, use the parameter or the global variable?
		-random forklifts generation
	-anonymize code
	-check zPosition for child objects (under each view controller), if the base zPosition is required
